# Colophon

This website is hosted on [GitHub Pages](http://github.com), my fonts (Adelle, Proxima Nova, and Tisa) are hosted on [TypeKit](http://typekit.com/fonts), Analytics are recorded using [Google Analytics](http://google.com/analytics) and [GoSquared](https://www.gosquared.com), my DNS is provided by [Cloudflare](http://cloudflare.com), and I buy my domains from [IWantMyName](http://IWantMyName.com) and [Gandi](https://www.gandi.net).

Articles are published using [git](http://git-scm.com) on my [2013 11" MacBook Air](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00DCR3SQG/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=B00DCR3SQG&linkCode=as2&tag=danietomli-21), or using the [GitHub](http://github.com) web interface. They are written using [iA Writer](http://www.iawriter.com/) on Mac and iOS before publishing.

I built this site using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and [Sass](http://sass-lang.com) in [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com).
