<p>ProjectHermes began as my project for <a href='https://youngrewiredstate.org'>Young Rewired State 2013</a>, and then (after a mad rebuilding couple of hours after a computer died), went on to win the &#8220;Should Exist&#8221; category.</p>

<h1 id='projecthermes'>ProjectHermes</h1>

<p>ProjectHermes is a tool for finding those who wish to hurt others through the internet, that detects trolls, racists, misogynists and bullies through natural language analysis.</p>

<h1 id='why_should_it_exist'>Why Should It exist?</h1>

<ul>
<li>To raise awareness of and change the way people think about important topics such as bullying, misogyny and racism.</li>

<li>Potentially saving lives by stopping bullying - as it will be easier to find those bullying online.</li>

<li>The vast amount of data that goes through Twitter can be easy to miss, Hermes highlights the key points that often go unnoticed by everyone but its target - who can often feel unable to speak out or raise awareness.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id='currently'>Currently</h1>

<p>At the moment, Hermes is limited, after originally losing its source, I have rebuilt the ability to stream, detect directly targeted bullying, and a simple front-end.</p>

<p>I am building in more functionality in the natural language areas at the moment, and then will be building a front-end.</p>

<h1 id='future'>Future</h1>

<ul>
<li>To be open-sourced, as this is a project to change the world, and we can only do this by working together for a better future. It also has an easily extensible structure, to allow for people to use it for their own projects and ideas, as a tool for change.</li>

<li>I also intend on increasing reach and functionality, to add more responsibility to what we say online by finding related social profiles for the content, creating a safe future without fear of mass hate, for us and our children, hopefully saving even a small percentage of the 5000+ people that commit suicide each year due to bullying.</li>

<li>I&#8217;d also like to create a simple platform to get people to find help for their issues, such as links and contact details for local authorities and other help groups.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id='problems'>Problems</h1>

<ul>
<li>Currently, I only have access to 0.01% of tweets using the /sample endpoint on the twitter api, to be truly efficient, I need access to the firehose, this can only be accessed through a twitter partner like datasift, and this is likely to cost a lot of money, I need to raise funding for this, or get a partnership with such companies.</li>

<li>I also need to rent some pretty powerful servers from somewhere like Amazon Web Services, to cope with such vast amounts of data.</li>

<li>Awareness, I also need to get the platform out to people, to show them what is really happening on the internet, so that we can begin to change the world.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id='closing'>Closing</h1>

<p>ProjectHermes can hopefully do some real good in the world, but only with the right support. We need to <em>act</em> to <em>change</em>, for a better future, for ourselves, our children, and our children&#8217;s children.</p>
