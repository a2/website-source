<div id="content">
<p>A short while ago, around a month or so, Barnes and Noble lowered the price of the <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/140053271X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=140053271X&linkCode=as2&tag=danietomli-21">Nook SimpleTouch</a> to £29, and I decided to pick one up from Asda (By the time I got round to ordering they were sold out everywhere).</p>

<h2 id="unboxing_experience">Unboxing Experience</h2>

<p>The device began to impress from the moment I opened the box, it’s well built, comfortable to hold and lightweight, checking all my mental requirements for something to compete with a good old printed book. It’s packaging is strong, and high quality, as are its included accessories (i.e the USB cable).</p>

<h2 id="first_impressions">First Impressions</h2>

<p>When the device first <em>arrives</em> you have to leave it to charge for an hour or so, but after <strong>this you a free to purchase</strong> books from the store, or copy in your existing epub <em>collection</em>.</p>

<p>The setup experience is mostly good, apart from my accidental tendency to accidentally hit the back button that is located on the bottom left of the keyboard (this seems really strange to me), and meant it took about 10 mins to fill in my debit card details.</p>

<h2 id="battery_life">Battery Life</h2>

<p>The Nook’s battery life is incredible, I’ve used the device for about an hour and a half a day on average since it arrived, with WiFi left on, and have downloaded about 8 books from its store, and as I look now it has just hit 50% battery - pretty incredible, you just don’t need to worry about checking it.</p>

<h2 id="the_screen">The Screen</h2>

<p>The screen is much better than e-readers I’ve seen in the past, only requiring a full screen refresh every 6 page turns, and only featuring an extremely small amount of ghosting (I’ve only noticed it twice). The contrast is excellent, and makes reading a real joy, even in bright sunlight.</p>

<h2 id="other_features">Other features</h2>

<p>The nook allows you to take notes on parts of books, and even share snippets to Twitter or Facebook, as well as defining words you may not understand, this, in my opinion is an extremely useful feature if reading very old books to clarify that you are correct with the meaning of words.</p>

<h2 id="drawbacks">Drawbacks</h2>

<p>There is a bug with the OS that if you are reading a book copied from a computer, and you plug the device back into a computer, it may loose the page you were on in the book and although annoying, is not necessarily a deal breaker as a fix should be rolled out in the future.</p>

<h2 id="store_content">Store Content</h2>

<p>Its store has tonnes of excellent books at extremely good prices, I have picked up books at as low as £1.79, which has made me read much more. (If I get into a book, I’ll read it in a single sitting, which at the price of print media gets very expensive quite quickly, and put me off reading much for a while).</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>In conclusion, it’s an excellent device for reading and is specialised for doing so, with really no other features - just how it should be. Although it has a few drawbacks, it’s an impeccable device for the price, and it is well recommended to anyone who may be considering an e-reader who isn’t tied into any particular ecosystem.</p>
