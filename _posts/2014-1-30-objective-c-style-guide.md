Recently I decided to formalise a style-guide for the way I write objective-c, as an excercise to both analyse the way I write code, to put with projects that I lead for other developers to follow, and to get feedback to improve the way I write code if there is a vital flaw.

You can see it in a gist [here](https://gist.github.com/DanielTomlinson/8722309#dot-notation-syntax).

If you have any comments, send me a tweet [@dantoml](http://twitter.com/DanToml) or leave a comment on the gist.


Thanks,
Daniel!
