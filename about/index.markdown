# About Daniel

<img src="/assets/images/profile.jpg" class="profile" draggable='false' />
Hello, my name is Daniel Tomlinson. I build iOS App's and write things. 

I'm a Mobile App Engineer at [WeAreBase](http://wearebase.com), build my own products at RocketApps - I'm currently building [Captain](http://twitter.com/GetCaptain) a DigitalOcean management app for iOS, and write a regular column for the [Observer](http://observer.theguardian.com).

I live and work by the sea in Bournemouth, England - but I hail from the City of Derby and occasionally return to see my family.

I love to write, and will occasionally post articles here about things that I'm passionate about, such as technology, education, programming, and other thoughts that may arise.

If you'd like to get in touch, my email address is: [Dan@Tomlinson.io](mailto:Dan@Tomlinson.io)
