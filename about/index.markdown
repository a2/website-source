# About Daniel

<img src="/assets/images/profile.jpg" class="profile" draggable='false' />
My name is Daniel Tomlinson, and I'm a developer/designer. I'm interested in how things work, and how we can improve things for people.

I live and work in Derby, England - currently as an iOS engineer and Back-end Web developer with various companies, agencies, start-ups and individuals. I also develop my own products.

I create experiences for people, to improve the ways in which we interact with technology and to create genuinely useful software and products that can positively affect peoples lives in various ways such as through making tasks easier, improving inter-personal relationships, and widening access to data and information.

When not developing, I take part in various other activities, such as speaking at meetups and conferences, walking, cycling, gaming and writing or just hanging out with friends.

I've also released a few things of my own (defunct apps are those that I stopped developing and pulled from the store):
- HackerNews for iPhone (Currently undergoing a big update)
- TwiDraw (defunct)
- Elementary (defunct)
- WeatherApp (defunct)
