# About Daniel

<img src="/assets/images/profile.jpg" class="profile" draggable='false' />
My name is Daniel Tomlinson, and I'm a developer/designer, as well as a Student at Allestre Woodlands school. I'm interested in how things work, and how we can improve peoples lives using technlogoy.

I live in Derby, England - currently as an iOS engineer and Back-end Web developer with various companies, agencies, start-ups and individuals. I also develop my own things.

I love going to various events and hackathons, and have received a couple of awards, such as a Google Code Award and the Young Rewired State Should Exist category.

I also like to write, hence running this blog, and writing for the Observer as a monthly tech columnist in the Observer Tech Monthly.

I also love to help others learn to code, and teach a weekly class at my school for year 7s, based around Scratch and Python.

When not developing, I take part in various other activities, such as speaking at meetups and conferences, walking, cycling, gaming and writing or just hanging out with friends.
