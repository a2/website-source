# About Daniel

<img src="/assets/images/profile.jpg" class="profile" draggable='false' />
Hello, my name is Daniel Tomlinson. I build iOS App's and write things. 

Currently, I build iOS applications at [ShowMyHomework](http://showmyhomework.co.uk), build my own products at RocketApps - I'm currently building [Captain](http://twitter.com/GetCaptain) a DigitalOcean management app for iOS, and something unnanounced. I also write a regular column for the [Observer](http://observer.theguardian.com).

I love to write, and will occasionally post articles here about things that I'm passionate about, such as technology, education, programming, and other thoughts that may arise.

If you'd like to get in touch, my email address is: [Dan@Tomlinson.io](mailto:Dan@Tomlinson.io)
