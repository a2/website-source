# About Daniel

<img src="/assets/images/profile.jpg" class="profile" draggable='false' />
Hey, I'm Daniel. I build user-centered mobile applications at <a href="http://wearebase.com">Base</a>. I love to know what makes things tick, and to see solutions in problems.

I'm passionate about building software that people will *love* to use, and strive to solve new problems, and improve existing solutions to create better experiences for the user.

I also love going to various events (such as conferences and hackathons), and enjoy to hear about how others have solved various problems, and to help others who may have experienced similar problems.


I have also received a couple of awards, such as a Google Code Award and the Young Rewired State Should Exist category.

I also like to write, hence running this blog, and writing for the Observer as a monthly tech columnist in the Observer Tech Monthly.

If you'd like to talk, you can email me: [Dan@Tomlinson.io](mailto:Dan@Tomlinson.io)
