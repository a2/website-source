# Hi, I'm Daniel.

I'm a software developer who specialises in building applications for iOS. I'm incredibly  passionate about users experience and privacy as well how we can make sustainable software development businesses that don't rely upon data as a business model.
 
 I build the  [Show My Homework](https://showmyhomework.co.uk)  for iOS, where I try to improves the lives of students, parents, and teachers through easy to use and time saving software. I also run [RocketApps](http://rocketapps.co) where I am currently focusing on building developer tools, currently in the form of [Captain](http://getcaptain.com), a DigitalOcean management tool for iOS.
 I also write a regular column for the Observer Tech Monthly, and have written a few other pieces for the Guardian. 
 
I have also spoken at a few events and conferences on topics ranging from building mobile software, to the ethical implications of technology and how it allows young people to do far more than ever before.

I received a Google Code Award and YRS Should Exist award for my work on Project Hermes, a tool that detected trolling and bullying on Twitter at YRS 2013.

I also try to help and support young people who've had problems with bullying wherever possible, and tried to raise awareness by sharing some of my own experiences [here](http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/mar/08/programming-saved-me-from-bullying).

If you'd like to get in touch, I'm on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/DanToml) or if you'd like to get in touch privately, you can send me an email: [dan@tomlinson.io](mailto:dan@tomlinson.io).
