As an avid user of technology and developer, I often beta test and purchase a lot of new applications, however more recently, I have noticed an ever increasing trend of applications that stray from the common methods of interaction and design, although creative, this is often terrible for the average end-user.

I really do like to see new ways of interacting with technology, in fact, I’ve tried some things myself, however, the average user often learns the common conventions of OS, such as swiping to the left on tableviews to delete items, but when this isn’t the case, on applications such as EvoMail (where to delete from the e-mail list, you must first tap an icon on the toolbar, unlike the convention of a navigation bar), it leaves the user feeling out of control and powerless. As Aral Balkan said: 


    “Good Design should Empower, Amuse and Delight”


This is a great phrase for many reasons, and can be viewed in a few different ways, but personally, I see it as a wake up call, telling designers and developers that it is their responsibilty to make the end user feel powerful and in control of the product. More people need to do that in order to remove the stigma involved with the use of computers, to stop people from being scared of using them, help them to understand whats going on, without being complicated, for example, if an error occurs with an API you use, rather than your app crashing or returning a status code, or a patronising message, present something informative and with simple steps to try and fix it.

 “It appears the -insert service name- is unavailable,please ensure you have a strong internet connection”
In closing, we need to make things consistent for the end user, follow standard patterns and interactions, make your app feel natural to the end-user. Make it usable for your great-grandma.
