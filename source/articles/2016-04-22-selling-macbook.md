I'm selling my beloved 12" MacBook due to the release of the new Rose Gold version.
It's a 1.2 Ghz, Space Grey, 8GB RAM, 512GB SSD model with a UK keyboard that cost me about £1200 new.
There is a slight dint on one corner on the lid from an unfortunate incident with the back of a plane seat.

If you're interested, it's £600 to a good home - this includes delivery inside the United Kingdom.

If you are a student and need a new machine for school then you can have it for £500.

If you have any questions, then drop me an email: dan@tomlinson.io or tweet @dantoml
