Many people have complained about Skype losing audio since Mavericks, and I fixed it in the GM, and forgot about it until @xiotex voiced the issue on Twitter today.

The issue is caused by one of the new energy saving features in Mavericks -> App Nap. App Nap essentially puts apps that are not currently focused to sleep, and is mostly great, although it can have some bad side effects.

To disable AppNap for Skype, right click the Skype icon in Finder, click get info, and the disable app nap option.
