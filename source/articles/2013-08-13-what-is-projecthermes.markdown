ProjectHermes began as my project for [Young Rewired State 2013](https://youngrewiredstate.org), and then (after a mad rebuilding couple of hours after a computer died), went on to win the "Should Exist" category.

# ProjectHermes
ProjectHermes is a tool for finding those who wish to hurt others through the internet, that detects trolls, racists, misogynists and bullies through natural language analysis.

# Why Should It exist?
- To raise awareness of and change the way people think about important topics such as bullying, misogyny and racism.
- Potentially saving lives by stopping bullying - as it will be easier to find those bullying online.
- The vast amount of data that goes through Twitter can be easy to miss, Hermes highlights the key points that often go unnoticed by everyone but its target - who can often feel unable to speak out or raise awareness.

# Currently
At the moment, Hermes is limited, after originally losing its source, I have rebuilt the ability to stream, detect directly targeted bullying, and a simple front-end.

I am building in more functionality in the natural language areas at the moment, and then will be building a front-end.

# Future
- To be open-sourced, as this is a project to change the world, and we can only do this by working together for a better future. It also has an easily extensible structure, to allow for people to use it for their own projects and ideas, as a tool for change.
- I also intend on increasing reach and functionality, to add more responsibility to what we say online by finding related social profiles for the content, creating a safe future without fear of mass hate, for us and our children, hopefully saving even a small percentage of the 5000+ people that commit suicide each year due to bullying.
- I'd also like to create a simple platform to get people to find help for their issues, such as links and contact details for local authorities and other help groups.

# Problems
- Currently, I only have access to 0.01% of tweets using the /sample endpoint on the twitter api, to be truly efficient, I need access to the firehose, this can only be accessed through a twitter partner like datasift, and this is likely to cost a lot of money, I need to raise funding for this, or get a partnership with such companies.
- I also need to rent some pretty powerful servers from somewhere like Amazon Web Services, to cope with such vast amounts of data.
- Awareness, I also need to get the platform out to people, to show them what is really happening on the internet, so that we can begin to change the world.

# Closing
ProjectHermes can hopefully do some real good in the world, but only with the right support. We need to _act_ to _change_, for a better future, for ourselves, our children, and our children's children.
