# Contact Daniel

If you'd like to work with me, or just fancy a chat, there are a variety of ways to get in touch, such as:

Tweeting me on Twitter \([@DanToml](http://twitter.com/dantoml)\), or IM'ing on Skype \([DanToml](skype://dantoml)\), or mailing me via e-mail \([Dan@Tomlinson.io](mailto:dan@tomlinson.io)\), and I'll try to reply as soon as possible.
